# LeetCode Daily Challenge Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to a collaborative effort among [Your Name] and friends to solve one LeetCode problem per day. The goal is to enhance our problem-solving skills, share knowledge, and strengthen our understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Daily Problem Solving

- Each day, a new LeetCode problem will be selected for everyone to solve.
- Problems will be chosen based on different difficulty levels to accommodate various skill levels.
- Solutions can be submitted in the dedicated directory for that day's problem.

### Directory Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ Problems

### File Naming Convention

- Use a consistent file naming convention for solutions, e.g., `Solution.py`, `Solution.java`.
- Include a markdown file (`Problem.md`) with the problem statement, constraints, and any additional information.

### Code Review and Discussions

- Encourage code reviews among collaborators.
- Discussions about different approaches, optimizations, and alternative solutions are highly encouraged.
